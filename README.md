This is a really hacky JavaScript implementation of Dreamworks' technique to animate fire.
Heavily inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/timsoret/status/788524951959732224?lang=en">this breakdown tweet from Tim Soret</a>.

## How to run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
